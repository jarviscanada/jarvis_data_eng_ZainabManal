      "description": "Conceptualized and developed a student identification system for university classrooms, utilising Bluetooth signals emitted from laptops. The scope of the project encompassed signal reception, identification, and the determination of student locations. The application received and identified unique Bluetooth signals and then determined the location of students associated with a specific signal.",

      "description": "Designed and implemented a cloud-based healthcare service system used to facilitate booking and hosting online appointments with healthcare practitioners. Developed during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, it aimed to streamline doctor's appointments, ensuring that they were easily accessible  while minimising human contact. The system integrated a WebRTC API for real-time audio and video communication. The frontend was built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and the platform was hosted on the Google Cloud Platform.",

      "description": "Implemented a Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent tool on a remote CentOS machine using technologies such as Docker, GitHub, PostgreSQL, and Crontab. The tool was used to collect and monitor real-time hardware specifications and CPU memory usage from the host machine and store the data within a Postgres database. The project is designed for users with clusters of machines in their projects, providing real-time insights into resource usage. Testing was done manually and each script was tested to ensure that it adhered to specifications and collected the required data.",

        "JDBC App: Developed a basic stock application which retrieved data on selected stocks from the Alpha Vantage website and allowed users to buy or sell specified quantities of those stocks. The application used Core Java and JDBC (Java DataBase Connectivity) to implement a DAO (Data Access Object) layer. Data was stored in a PostgreSQL database and underwent testing with both JUnit and Mockito.",
        "Grep App: Implemented a grep command line replica using Java, Lambda, and Stream APIs. The application searches within a user provided directory, identifying lines in files that match a specified regex pattern. These lines are then written to a text file. The application was packaged using Maven and was then deployed on Docker Hub via Docker."

The application allowed users to stimulate buying and selling stocks, as well as manage accounts, quotes, and retrieve stock information from IEX Cloud. The application was implemented using Core Java and Springboot for dependency management. The IEX Cloud API was used to fetch latest stock information and PostgreSQL was used to define database schemas. Maven was used to managed Java dependencies and testing was done with JUnit 4.",
