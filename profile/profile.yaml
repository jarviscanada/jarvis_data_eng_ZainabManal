# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a passionate learner and a highly motivated software engineering graduate from Ontario Tech University. Throughout my academic journey, I gained an expertise in agile methodology, project management, and a proficiency in programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, and Python. Alongside my academics, I completed several projects as well as an internship which allowed me to refine my collaborative problem-solving and effective communication.I am drawn to the ever-changing nature of the technology field and thrive off the challenges intrinsic to software development. As such, Ive worked on a diverse range of projects involving AI implementations, mobile app development, and distributed systems, and have used technologies like MongoDB, Firebase, and Windows Desktop application development. The opportunity to work on both the front-end and back-end greatly appeals to me as it fosters continuous development and learning. As a recent graduate, I bring a new perspective and a commitment to always getting better and I am eager to contribute my skills in an innovative environment.

    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Implemented a Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent tool on a remote CentOS machine using technologies such as Docker, GitHub, PostgreSQL, and Crontab. The tool was used to collect and monitor real-time hardware specifications and CPU memory usage from the host machine and store the data within a Postgres database. The project is designed for users with clusters of machines in their projects, providing real-time insights into resource usage. Testing was done manually and each script was tested to ensure that it adhered to specifications and collected the required data.
